# Sword quest

## Description

You control the "legendary sword", but you are stuck in a stone and need a "hero" t pick you up

To start the game, a "hero" npc character picks you up, and after being removed from the stone you gain control of the sword.

The "hero" npc tries to impair your movement slightly, and you try to control the direction of movement

The objective is getting to the "shrine of weapons"(placeholder) to free yourself from the living weapon curse by sacrificing a soul at the "shrine of weapons". 

(Lore)The game ends, but the previous "Hero" turns into a sword, falls down a cliff, and gets stuck in a rock...
